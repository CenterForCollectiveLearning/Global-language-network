<!--<p>Multilingual speakers play an important role in facilitating cross-cultural communication. They bridge the language barrier and help information and ideas diffuse from one language group to another.<br><br>We map the connections created by multilinguals among over sixty language groups by analyzing data from over a billion tweets, the edit histories of all Wikipedia language editions, and 2.2 million translations of printed books.</p>-->
<p>Most interactions between cultures require the overcoming a language barrier, which is why multilingual speakers play an important role in facilitating such interactions. In addition, certain languages–not necessarily the most spoken ones–are more likely than others to serve as intermediary languages.</p>
<p>We present the Global Language Network (GLN), a new approach for studying global networks using data generated by tens of millions of speakers from all over the world. The GLN was created from the following sources:
	<dl class="dl-horizontal">
		<dt>Twitter</dt>
		<dd>550 million tweets by over 17 million unique users</dd>
		<dt>Wikipedia</dt>
		<dd>382 million Wikipedia edits by 2.5 million editors in 238 Wikipedia language editions</dd>
		<dt>Books</dt>
		<dd>2.2 million translations of printed books in over a thousand languages, as collected by <a href="http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7810&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html">UNESCO's Index Translationum</a></dd>
	</dl>
</p>
<p>The result is an interactive network that shows how language groups influence each other. Looking at the GLN, one can easily see which languages are the most connected and thus most influential, and explore potential paths through which  information transfers from one group to another.</p>

<p>Applications of the GLN include promotion of cultural interactions, prediction of trends, and marketing. In this demo, you are welcome to check out the global popularity of your company by language groups. You will find which language group is aware your brand, how its fame spread along the years, and its potential reach. When you're done checking how you fare against the competition, learn how Nobel  laureates become famous around the globe, literally minutes after the announcement.</p>
