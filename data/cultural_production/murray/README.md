Processed export table for regressions, from Charles Murray's Human Accomplishment. The full list with all the names is avaialble in the old repo.

Two files in this folder contain cultural exports by country, after resolving and cleaning some of the Murray names.

Number of people:
-All: 3869
-Born 1800-1950: 1655

2013-05/: These are the values used for the May Science submission.

2013-10/: USE THESE FILES! using an updated country-lang conversion. These are the values used for the November submission. Note that the exports-by-country files haven't changes: they're copied here for compatibility with other scripts. 
NOTE: in this version I fixed an typo in a country name (was "Grrece"), which caused two different values for Greece (8 ppl and 1 person) and may have skewed conversion to languages and the regressions.
