Conversion
***********

iso-639-3-20120726_conversion_nogeneric.txt: prepared 7/23/2012 using the ISO-639-3 files from above (6/14/2012 release)
All datasets were converted to macrolanguages before we started processing and analyzing them. 

Twitter and Wikipedia (roughly ISO639-1)
*********************

Twitter: CLD detects 205 languages, of which 86 feature in our Twitter data set.
Wikipedia: our dataset featured 284 language editions (actually, that's the number of languages on Bruno's conversion table)

Of the above:
145 languages are common to Twitter/CLD and Wikipedia. All are converted to 639-3, except for Bihari.
60 languages are on Twitter but not on Wikipedia. Of which, six (6) are converted to ISO639-3:
CLD_Code	CLD_Name	ISO639-3_Code	ISO639-3_Name
fil	TAGALOG	fil	Filipino
jw	JAVANESE	jav	Javanese (Macro)
kha	KHASI	kha	Khasi
nb	NORWEGIAN	nob	Norwegian Bokomal)
syr	SYRIAC	syr	Syriac (Macro)
zh-TW	ChineseT	zho	Chinese (Macro)

fil	TAGALOG -> fil	Filipino
jw	JAVANESE -> jav	Javanese
nb	NORWEGIAN -> Bokomal)
syr	SYRIAC
zh-TW	CHINESE (TRADITIONAL) -> Chinese (macrolanguge)


139 languages are on Wikipedia but not on Twitter:

Macrolanguages
*******
Languages were consolidated to ISO639-3 macrolanguages, thus all variants of Chinese appear under "zho" ("Chinese"); all variants of Arabic under "ara" ("Arabic"), "Malay"etc. There are two notable additions: (1) Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian were consolidated into "Serbo-Croatian" even though the latter had been deprecated as a macrolanguage; this is mostly because CLD cannot distinguish the written forms of the three languages. (2) Filipino ("fil" in CLD) and Tagalog ("tl" in Wikipedia) were merged into one Filipino language "fil" ("Filipino"), as they are essentially the same language.      


>>>>> IGNORE THE FOLLOWING -- this has been changed:
The following languages are merged at source level. They are converted like the rest:
id + ms -> msa	Malay (Macro)
zh + zh-TW (both listed as zh) - > zho	Chinese (Macro)	
hr + sr -> Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian (Macro)
>>>>> STOP IGNORING...

Wikipedia
**********
Of the 6/12/2012 (data of processing, not retrieval!) set, the following 10 langs were not converted:

Notable languages that weren't converted are:
-be-x-old: classical orthography. The "Classical Belarusian" edition spawned from the "Official" one and has a few articles more, but also fewer views, so decided to go with new one. Seems like the same audience anyway. http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/Sitemap.htm
-Simple English: not converted
-no 639-3: roa_tara, tokipona, bh, map_bms, nds_nl (a family individual ISO639-3 languages)
-Multiple dialects on ISO639-3 without a macrolanguage, cannot map to a specific variant: nah
-Spanish-Philipino Creole: cbk_zam
-Wikipedia no longer exists: hz

1 code unique to the Index Translationum was removed:
not supplied

46 do not conform with ISO639-3. Altogether there are 680 translations from these languages (200 of which to "Catalan, Valencian") and 329 to these languages (229 to "Catalan, Valencian"). 
san-pr	Pankrit
