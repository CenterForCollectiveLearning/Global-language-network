1. The Google News mentions matrix, and the flight data networks, essentially connect countries to other countries (country:country). The network of languages we gnenerated from Twitter connected language to other languages (lang:lang), and the Wikipedia dataset is both: for unregistered users identified by IP Bruno connected country to language (e.g., >1M users from Australia contribute to the English edition), and for registered users we will try to connect language to language (through a bi-partite network of contributors-languages).

2. We therefore need to map languages to countries and vice versa.
- Sparse matrix/dictionary, e.g., countries["English"]->["USA", "UK", "Australia", ...], as well as languages["USA"]->["English", "Spanish", ...]
- Map as many languages as we can, but eventually we'll only use the languages we can detect on Twitter.

3. Data sources: parse the following and populate above dictionary: 
- CIA World Fact Book: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2098.html#top.
Lists languages spoken in each country, sorted by frequency, with percentages for some. Note that there are no overlaps, probably meaning that it only accounts for native/first languages.
- Ethnologue: very detailed, not as easy to parse: http://www.ethnologue.com/country_index.asp?place=World 
- Wikipedia: most language pages and country pages do not contain a structured infobox with breakdown of languages by country and countries by language for us to parse. Pages such as this exist: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_Spanish_is_an_official_language, but not for every language (e.g., no German)

4. Determine cutoff: how many people/what minimum percentage of population should speak a language in a given country so we consider it. 
- Initial settings: pick first three languages by CIA; if percentage are listed, add languages until percentage goes over 75%.

5. Convert the Google News matrix from country:country to lang:lang:
- for each line in the matrix: # format: country, reported_language, mentioned_country, # mentions
	- Get languages spoken in mentioned_country (mentioned_languages_list)
	- Distribute the number of mentions by percentage breakdown (?)
	- Add to each cell (reported_language, mentioned_languages_list[i]) the number of relative number of mentions we found.
	- Note: we need to normalize language name so they match the code we use. E.g., all variants of Chinese go to "zh-zh-TW",
	all variants of Portuguese go to "pt", both Indonesian and Malay go to "id-ms"
	
Example: 
	- Google News France (in French) mentions Singapore 1030 times. 
	- Language distribution in Singapore, according to the CIA World Fact Book: Mandarin (official) 35%, English (official) 23%, Malay (official) 14.1%, Hokkien 11.4%, Cantonese 5.7%, Teochew 4.9%, Tamil (official) 3.2%, other Chinese dialects 1.8%, other 0.9% (2000 census)
	- Hence, we increment the following cells in our lang:lang matrix by the following values:
		(fr, zh-zh-TW) : +597  (72.9% of mentions -- we don't distinguish different variations of Chinese
		(fr, en) : +237 (23%)
		(fr, id-ms) : +145 (14.1% -- we merge id and ms)
		(fr, Other) : +51 (all the rest, including Tamil, which we don't have)
