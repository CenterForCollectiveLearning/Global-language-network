IMPORTANT NOTE: 
This is a staging folder only. Files and folders might be overwritten by
future runs of the mapping scripts. Once you're done extracing the network, 
copy the results to the respective folder under analysis/ to use them.

Run prep_std_tables.R to generate the standardized node and edge table
to be used for analysis. Modify the INPUT.DIR for each script 
so it points to the desired folder under mapping_results/ 

- analysis/paper-2013-05/ contains the tables used for the original GLN paper.

Folder structure:
- Each folder contains the standardized node and edge tables for the respective dataset.
