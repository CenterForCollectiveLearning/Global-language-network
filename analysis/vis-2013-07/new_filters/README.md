Using a stricter filter for the number of tweets/edits we require a user to make in order to be included:
min. 10 tweets in a language to consider a language for a given user (was 2)
min. 25 tweets overall for a user to consider him/her (was 5)

Using a more lax filter on common.num:
60 users for Twitter and Wikipedia (was 500)
40 translations for the translations GLN (was 300)

The reason for the change was to increase certainty of Twitter lagnuage identification.

As a result, there are fewer links in the Twitter GLN, but more on Wikipedia and translations GLN. Also more nodes in the last two.

The EV centrality bump chart is somewhat different than the original one I created. Compare gln_ranking_new_filters.pdf and gln_ranking_orig.pdf.
However, the connected languages on Twitter are still very different from the ones on Wikipedia/Translations.
